# Fractol
Fractal representation


Key binding are not well sets.

On qwerty :
	Left part of the keyboard :
	`  - Switch the render mode between CPU to GPU
	1  - Change the fractal to Mandelbrot
	2  - Change to Julia
	3  - Change to Burning Ship
	Enter - Reset the position and iterations
	p - (only on Julia) Switch between knonw and remaraquable form
	f - (only on Julia) Modify Julia with the Mouse coordinates in real time (way better in GPU mode)
	c - Switch colors
	Space - Switch between locked and unlocked mode
			Locked mode : can drag the fractal's position with Mouse
			Unlocked mode : L-Click to Zoom, R-Click to Unzoom
	Escape - exit

	NumPad :
	+ Up the number of iterations
